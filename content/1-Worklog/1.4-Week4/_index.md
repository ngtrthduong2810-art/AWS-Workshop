### Results Achieved in Week 4:

#### Knowledge

**What is Amazon RDS?**

- Understand that Amazon RDS is a relational database service managed by AWS.
- RDS allows users to create and operate databases without manually managing physical servers or database virtual machines.
- RDS is suitable for transaction processing systems such as user management, orders, payments, or structured data applications.
- RDS supports many database engines such as Amazon Aurora, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

**Managed Service in RDS**

- Understand that RDS is a managed service, so users do not need to directly manage the underlying operating system of the DB Instance.
- AWS supports tasks such as backup, patching, software updates, scaling, Multi-AZ, and failover.
- Users can focus more on database design, connection security, and application operation.

**VPC, Subnet, and DB Subnet Group**

- Understand that VPC is a virtual private network used to isolate AWS resources.
- Know how to create a VPC with public and private subnets.
- Public subnets are suitable for EC2 instances that need Internet access.
- Private subnets are suitable for RDS to limit direct access from the Internet.
- Understand that a DB Subnet Group is a collection of subnets assigned to RDS.
- A DB Subnet Group should include subnets in at least two Availability Zones to support high availability.

**Security Groups for EC2 and RDS**

- Understand that Security Group works as a firewall for EC2 and RDS.
- EC2 Security Group needs to open necessary ports such as:
  - SSH: `22`
  - HTTP: `80`
  - HTTPS: `443`
  - Application port: `5000`
- RDS Security Group needs to open the database port, for example MySQL/Aurora uses port `3306`.
- RDS should only allow connections from the EC2 Security Group instead of allowing wide public access.

**EC2 Instance as Application Server**

- Know how to create an Amazon Linux EC2 Instance.
- Know how to select Amazon Linux 2023 AMI.
- Know how to choose a suitable Instance Type such as `t2.micro` or `t3.micro`.
- Know how to attach a Key Pair for SSH access.
- Know how to connect to EC2 using MobaXterm through Public IP or Public DNS.

**RDS Database Instance**

- Know how to create an RDS Database Instance using Standard create.
- Know how to configure engine, version, template, master username, password, VPC, and Security Group.
- Know how to check the RDS status from `Creating` to `Available`.
- Know how to get the Endpoint, Port, and Username so that the application or EC2 can connect to the database.

**Deploying an Application Connected to RDS**

- Know how to clone source code from GitHub to EC2.
- Know how to install Node.js, npm, and required packages such as Express, dotenv, and MySQL.
- Know how to create a `.env` file to store database connection information, including Endpoint, Database Name, Username, and Password.
- Know how to create the `first_cloud_users` database, create the `user` table, and insert sample data.
- Know how to run the application using `npm start` and access it through port `5000`.

**Backup and Restore in RDS**

- Understand that RDS supports automated backup and manual snapshot.
- Know how to check backups in the Maintenance & backups tab.
- Know how to create a snapshot and restore it into a new DB Instance.
- Understand that a restored database will have a new Endpoint, so the application connection string must be updated if the new database is used.

**Resource Cleanup**

- Know how to delete RDS Database Instance, DB Snapshot, and DB Subnet Group.
- Know how to terminate EC2 Instance after completing the lab.
- Know how to delete Security Group, NAT Gateway, Elastic IP, and VPC if they are no longer used.
- Understand the importance of checking Billing Dashboard or Cost Explorer after cleanup to avoid unexpected charges.

#### Difficulties and Solutions

**Difficulties:**

- It was initially easy to confuse public subnets and private subnets.
- Incorrect Security Group configuration could prevent EC2 from connecting to RDS.
- Opening RDS access too widely to the Internet is unsafe.
- When creating a DB Subnet Group, subnets must be selected from at least two Availability Zones.
- When creating RDS, the master password must be remembered because it cannot be viewed again directly.
- If the application cannot connect to the database, the issue may come from an incorrect Endpoint, port, username/password, or Security Group configuration.
- When restoring a snapshot, the new database will have a new Endpoint, so the application configuration file must be updated.
- RDS, Snapshot, NAT Gateway, or Elastic IP may generate costs if they are not deleted.

**Solutions:**

- Use clear resource names such as:
  - `fcj-rds-vpc`
  - `fcj-public-subnet`
  - `fcj-private-subnet`
  - `fcj-ec2-sg`
  - `fcj-rds-sg`
  - `fcj-rds-subnet-group`
  - `fcj-rds-db`
- Place EC2 in a public subnet so that it can be accessed via SSH.
- Place RDS in a private subnet to limit direct access from the Internet.
- EC2 Security Group should only allow SSH from personal IP.
- RDS Security Group should only allow source from the EC2 Security Group.
- Always check RDS Endpoint, Port, and `Available` status before connecting.
- Check the `.env` file when the application cannot connect to the database.
- After restoring a snapshot, update `DB_HOST` if using the new database.
- After the lab, review all resources in EC2, RDS, VPC, and Billing.

### Summary of Week 4:

In Week 4, I learned and practiced deploying an application system that uses **Amazon RDS** as a relational database on AWS. Through the workshop, I understood the role of RDS in simplifying database administration, including database instance creation, security configuration, backup, restore, and monitoring.

In addition, I practiced combining multiple AWS services such as VPC, Subnet, Security Group, EC2, and RDS to build a complete application model. EC2 acts as the application server, while RDS acts as the database server. Separating the application layer and the database layer makes the system easier to manage, more secure, and closer to real-world deployment models.

Through this week, I also realized that network and security configuration are very important when working with RDS. If Security Group, Subnet, or DB Subnet Group is configured incorrectly, the application will not be able to connect to the database. Therefore, before deploying the application, it is necessary to carefully check the network architecture, access permissions, and connection information.
