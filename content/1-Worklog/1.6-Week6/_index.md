### Week 6 Evaluation:

- Completed the study of AWS Budgets for AWS cost management.
- Learned how to create a Budget using an available template.
- Created a Cost Budget to monitor monthly AWS spending.
- Created a Usage Budget to monitor AWS resource usage.
- Understood the difference between Cost Budget and Usage Budget.
- Understood the purpose of Reservation Budget for Reserved Instances.
- Understood the purpose of Savings Plans Budget for Savings Plans.
- Learned how to configure alert thresholds and email notifications.
- Learned how to check Budget health and Budget history.
- Learned how to clean up Budgets created during the lab.
- Became more aware of the importance of cost control when practicing AWS labs.

---

### Difficulties Encountered:

- The Billing and Cost Management interface contains many sections, so it was easy to confuse Bills, Cost Explorer, and Budgets at first.
- It was necessary to clearly distinguish Cost Budget from Usage Budget because they monitor different types of information.
- When configuring Usage Budget, it was important to choose the correct Usage type group.
- Some new AWS accounts may not show all Budget types immediately.
- AWS cost and usage data may be delayed, so the Budget may not show full data immediately after creation.
- RI Budget and Savings Plans Budget were more difficult to understand because they are related to long-term cost commitments.
- If the alert email is entered incorrectly, the user may not receive budget notifications.
- AWS Budgets only sends alerts. It does not automatically stop AWS services when the budget is exceeded.

---

### Solutions:

- Read each step in the workshop carefully before performing actions in the AWS Console.
- Take notes on the purpose of each Budget type:
  - Cost Budget monitors spending.
  - Usage Budget monitors resource usage.
  - Reservation Budget monitors Reserved Instances.
  - Savings Plans Budget monitors Savings Plans.
- When configuring alerts, enter the correct email address and check the mailbox for AWS notifications.
- Set multiple alert levels, such as 50%, 80%, and 100%, to control costs more effectively.
- Do not purchase Reserved Instances or Savings Plans in a learning account unless required.
- Delete practice Budgets after completing the lab to avoid unnecessary notifications.
- Check the Billing Dashboard after each lab session to detect unexpected costs.
- Combine AWS Budgets with regular resource cleanup habits to reduce the risk of unexpected AWS charges.

---

### Plan for Next Week:

- Continue learning about AWS Billing and Cost Management.
- Study AWS Cost Explorer to analyze costs by service, time, and account.
- Learn how to use the AWS Free Tier Dashboard to monitor free tier limits.
- Learn about AWS Cost Anomaly Detection to identify unusual spending.
- Study AWS Organizations and cost management for multiple AWS accounts.
- Practice checking the Billing Dashboard after each AWS lab.
- Prepare evidence screenshots, notes, and comments to complete the next weekly report.
